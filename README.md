This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow
I am being instructed to write a little about myself here. I'm 38, I'm married mother of 2, I have a chocolate lab named Malcom and a black cat named Miss Business. I live in Eastern Kentucky and have been interested in coding for a few years but never made the steps to learning until now. I'm excited to learn more!
